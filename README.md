# Property-Valuation-Exercise-MQE-

**Objective:** predict the price of the renovated Scheibler building at 936 Mellon Street in highland park.

**Backgrounds:** Frederick G Scheibler Jr. was a famous Pittsburgh Architect
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_G._Scheibler_Jr.). 

A 3 unit apartment building (1 unit on each of 3 floors) that he built in Highland Park is currently being renovated.  The renovations will add an Elevator to the building and will expand the living space on each floor â€“ adding an extra bedroom to each unit and expanding each unit by roughly 400 square feet. 

My Project the following parts:
1)	Use 2 distinctly different approaches (i.e. not just 2 different regression models) to estimate the market value of these properties.  

2)	Why is this a difficult question to answer? 

3)	 How did these difficulties impact your chosen approach?
