# Property-Valuation-Exercise-MQE-

This is a project I did during my graduate study (Master in Science, Quantitive Economics at University of Pittsburgh)

**Objective:** predict the price of the renovated Scheibler building at 936 Mellon Street in highland park.
**Backgrounds: ** Frederick G Scheibler Jr. was a famous Pittsburgh Architect
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_G._Scheibler_Jr.). 
A 3 unit apartment building (1 unit on each of 3 floors) that he built in Highland Park is currently being renovated.  The renovations will add an Elevator to the building and will expand the living space on each floor â€“ adding an extra bedroom to each unit and expanding each unit by roughly 400 square feet.
